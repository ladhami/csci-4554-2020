This project implements a virtual galaxy:

Recommended viewing order:The Milky Way -> Mercury -> Venus -> Jupiter -> Neptune  ->  Pluto1. In order to simulate the actual observation of planets in the universe, the system set up a light source to simulate the exposure of the sun.2. Users can zoom in and out of Venus by pressing the button.3. Users can pause the rotation of Venus by pressing the button to get a closer look at the surface4. Users can move planets up and down by adjusting phi5. Pluto, Neptune, Venus, Jupiter, and mercury were realized in the project6. Because different planets are at different distances from the sun, the light source design is also different.For example, Pluto is the largest distance from the sun, therefore it will dimmer than mercury7. Users can flexibly jump to different planets with the button8. To better simulate the Milky Way, particles are added with velocities, which apply some of the knowledge of chapter 10
